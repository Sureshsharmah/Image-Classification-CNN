# Image-Classification-CNN
ðŸš—ðŸš²ðŸšŒ End-to-End CNN Image Classification Project
This project demonstrates a full-cycle deep learning workflow designed for classifying images into three categories: bikes, cars, and buses. Starting from annotation using labelImg, it incorporates advanced techniques like YOLO and Ultralytics for object detection and preprocessing. Finally, a CNN model is implemented for accurate and efficient classification, showcasing the potential of AI in real-world applications.
